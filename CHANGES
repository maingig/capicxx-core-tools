Changes
=======

v3.2.0
- Adapted to CommonAPI 3.2.0
- Upgrade to Franca 0.13.1
- Improved evaluation of literal value expressions
- Allow typedefÂ´ed types within unions
- Updated xtend to v2.20.0
- Improve handling of derived enumerations
- Removed some unnecessary warnings

v3.1.12.3
- Prevent crash due to concurrent attribute access from stub itself
  and a remote client.

v3.1.12.2
- Reworked attribute locking in StubAdapter to prevent deadlock

v3.1.12.1
- Fixed data race in generated StubDefault when using attributes
- Fix extended unions with custom data types

v3.1.12
- Fix compiler warnings in generated code
- Test adaptions

v3.1.11
- Fix compiler warnings in generated code
- Test adaptions
- Validate array deployment parameters

v3.1.10
- Upgrade to JDK-1.8.
- Moved mutex lock in 'VerificationMainLoop::registerWatch' to avoid deadlock. The mutex was moved after registering the file descriptor. Otherwise a deadlock can occur when 'VerificationMainLoop::unregisterWatch' is called in parallel.
- Fixed THMainloopIndependence and THMainloopIntegration segfault. The problem is that a 'DispatchSource' has a pointer to its related 'Watch' as member variable and in the destructor of the dispatch source the watch is accessed. So a segfault can occur when the watch is deleted before the dispatch source.
- Merge core and binding deployments for attributes, broadcasts, methods and types instead of copying the core deployment into the lists of the binding deplyoment. The copying led to binding deployments getting lost because the core deployment overwrote the binding deployment when it was inserted into the map in class FDMapper.
- Fixed CMAttributeSubscription multithreading test.
- Relaxed timing requirements when TESTS_BAT is defined and fixed races in tests.
- Added test SubscribeAndUnsubscribeAndReSubscribe.
- It is now possible to deploy a broadcast with type 'error'. An error broadcast signals an occured error due to a method call and needs an appropriate error name. With a respective deployment file as input for the generators, they produce appropriate code to receive and send error replies.
- Check proxy pointer in TearDown to avoid sporadic crashes.
- Added CodeArtifactName deployment parameter.
- CommonAPI generator generate uncompilable code in case of: if enum 'namespace::A' extends enum 'other_namespace::B' which extends 'other_namespace::C', the namespace in the assign operator of 'A' is missing.
- Replace polling mechanism in Windows main-loop. The current polling mechanism of the main-loops is not reliable under Windows. It is replaced with a WSAPoll on the file descriptors instead of WSAWaitForMultipleEvents on wsa events.

v3.1.9.1
- Fix error when InstanceIds.hpp is #included in two independend compilation units.
